# Healthcare_Appointment_EDA

## Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing a healthcare dataset related to patient appointment attendance. The primary objective is to extract insights using descriptive analytics rather than predictive modeling. Key aspects include exploratory data analysis (EDA), data preprocessing, and visualization techniques to understand patient appointment trends.

### Dataset Description

The dataset contains patient appointment records with features such as:
  - *Patient ID*: Unique identifier for each patient.
  - *Appointment Details*: Information on scheduled appointments.
  - *Gender*: Patient gender.
  - *Attendance Status*: Classification of whether a patient attended their appointment or not.
  - *Appointment Scheduling*: Analysis of trends based on weekdays.

Project Components

1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) 
    * Understanding dataset structure and characteristics.
    * Using statistical methods like describe(), box plots, and visco plots for numerical data analysis.
    * Identifying patterns in appointment scheduling (higher activity from Monday to Wednesday, lower towards the weekend).

2. Data Preprocessing
    * Handling Missing Values: Using imputation methods such as regression or mean/median values to maintain data integrity.
    * Data Cleaning: Converting data types, creating new columns, and dropping irrelevant features
    * Handling Imbalanced Data: Exploring target variable distribution to ensure proper analysis.
    * One-Hot Encoding: Converting categorical variables into numerical format for unbiased representation in machine learning models.

3. Data Visualization
    * Correlation Analysis: Using a correlation matrix and heat maps to understand relationships between variables.
    * Univariate and Bivariate Analysis: Extracting insights from individual and paired variables to drive data-driven decisions.
    * Gender-based Trends: Analyzing appointment trends based on gender and show-up ratios across different age groups.

## Tools & Technologies

  - Python: Primary language for data analysis.
  - Pandas & NumPy: Data manipulation and analysis.
  - Matplotlib & Seaborn: Data visualization.
  - Power BI & Tableau (Future Work): Dashboards and reporting.

## Key Findings

- Female patients have more appointments than male patients.
- Most age groups exhibit equal show-up ratios, except certain categories like h0 and h1.
- Appointment scheduling trends indicate higher activity at the start of the week.

## Future Enhancements

- Incorporating Power BI and Tableau for advanced visualizations.
- Expanding statistical analysis techniques for deeper insights.
- Creating interactive dashboards for enhanced data exploration.
